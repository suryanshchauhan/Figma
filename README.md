# Figma

## Overview

This repository is a collection of my design practice work done in Figma. It includes JPG/PNG snapshots of my designs, as well as a final project: a cloned version of the Figma's Homepage. This repository serves as a visual catalog and proof of my journey through learning Figma, understanding UI/UX principles, and applying them in practical design situations.

## Contents

1. **Design Practice Work (JPGs/PNGs)** - This section consists of various design works done during my practice sessions. They are categorized based on design principles and design categories, such as typography, color theory, user interface (UI), user experience (UX), etc.

2. **Figma Homepage Clone** - A major project that is a cloned version of the Figma Homepage. This project showcases my understanding of Figma's functionalities and design principles.
